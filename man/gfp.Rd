  A data frame with 6234 observations on the following 33 variables.

  The following columns indicate whether or not the protein was
  localized in the specific region of the cell.  A protein can be
  localized in more than one region.

  Explanation for missing abundance values are given by

  \describe{
    \item{\code{missingAbundance}}{a factor with levels
      \code{low signal}, \code{not visualized} and
      \code{technical problem}}
  }
}
\details{

  The information on abundance is available in three columns.
  \code{abundance} gives (where available) absolute protein abundances
  determined by quantitative Western blot analysis of TAP-tagged
  strains.  Abundances that have a non-\code{NA} \code{error} value were
  done in triplicate with serial dilutions of purified TAP-tagged
  standards included in each gel, which substantially reduces the
  measurement error. In addition, for these strains, the tagged genes
  were confirmed to rescue the loss of function phenotype of the
  corresponding deletion strain.  For rows where \code{abundance} is
  missing (\code{NA}), the \code{missingAbundance} column gives the
  reason.  Possible reasons are:

  \describe{
    \item{\code{"not visualized"}}{Either the tagging was unsuccessful
      or no signal was detected.}
    \item{\code{"low signal"}}{The tagging was successful, but the
      signal was not sufficiently high above background to permit
      accurate quantitation (âˆ¼50 molecules/cell).}
    \item{\code{"technical problem"}}{The protein was detectable but
      could not be quantitated because it did not migrate as a single
      band or comigrated with the internal standards in the gel.}
  }

  Replicate analysis for a subset of tagged strains found a linear
  correlation coefficient of R = 0.94, with the pairs of proteins having
  a median variation of a factor of 2.0. This error analysis does not
  account for potential alterations in the endogenous levels of the
  proteins caused by the the fused tag, which may be particularly
  disruptive for small proteins.
